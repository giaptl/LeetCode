# Problem 1: Calling Mississippi
# In a new Replit, copy and paste the following function:
# def count_mississippi(limit):
#     for num in range(1, limit):
#     print( f"{num} mississippi")
# Call the function so that it prints out the following to the console (without calling the function more than once):
# 1 mississipi
# 2 mississipi
# 3 mississipi
# 4 mississipi
# 5 mississipi


# Problem 2: Swap Ends
# Write a function swap_ends() that accepts a string my_str as a parameter and returns a new string where the first and last characters from my_str are swapped.


# Problem 3: Is Pangram
# Write a function is_pangram() that takes in a string my_str as a parameter and returns True if the string is a pangram and False if not. A pangram is a sentence containing every letter in the English alphabet.


# Problem 4: Reverse String
# Write a function reverse_string() that takes a string my_str as a parameter and returns the string reversed.


# Problem 5: First Unique
# Write a function first_unique_char() that given a string my_str as a parameter, it finds the first non-repeating character in it and returns its index. If it does not exist, then return -1.


# Problem 6: Minimum Distance
# Write a function min_distance() that takes in a list of strings words and two strings word1 and word2' as parameters. The function should return the minimum distance between word1 and word2 in the list of words. The distance between one word and an adjacent word in the list is 1.

def min_distance(words, word1, word2):
    return words.index(word1) - words.index(word2)
#Test
words = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumped", "the"]
dist1 = min_distance(words, "quick", "jumped")
dist2 = min_distance(words, "the", "jumped")
print(dist1)
print(dist2)
words2 = ["code", "path", "code", "contribute",  "practice"]
dist3 = min_distance(words, "code", "practice")
print(dist3)
